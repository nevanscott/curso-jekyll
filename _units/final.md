title: Final Project
order: 5
description: |
  We will close out the class with a two-week final project period, where you'll work to develop a project of your own choosing. During these weeks, focus will be on completing the project. There will be a limited amount of class time focused on reviewing and extending topics explored earlier in the course. It is strongly encouraged that you start preparing for your final project prior to these two weeks.
