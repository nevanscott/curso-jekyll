## Suggestions

- You’ll have to make some quick assumptions in order to get started on this project. Acknowledge the assumptions by creating a a proto-persona.
- Make several variations on your design before deciding on a direction. Ask for feedback and input from your colleagues!
- Be careful not to rely too much on symbols while exploring design concepts. When you get closer to a confident final design, start cleaning up your document with a system of symbols and well-named layer groups.
- Use the [Material Design Theme](https://material.io/tools/theme-editor/)


## Presentation (6 minutes)

Your presentation should answer the following questions:

1. What variations on your design did you explore?
2. How does your design reflect the guidance in the Material Design documentation?
3. What would you do differently next time?


## Extra Mile

If you have time, string together some of your screens into a working prototype. Make it even more realistic by adding some animations!
