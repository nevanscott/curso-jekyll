**Updates pending**

Over the next few days, you’ll be creating an e-commerce website for a local business. Keep in mind that this is a speculative redesign for practice, so you won’t have access to the client or stakeholders.

The website you’re redesigning already has content. You’ll want to inventory and audit that content to determine:

- how the content should be organized
- what content to keep, cut, or edit
- how users can navigate the site
- what’s the most important content for users


## Setup

- Teams of 2–3
- 4 class days


## Materials

- Sketch
- Invision
- Principle


## Project Scope

Remember that this is a responsive redesign which means that your users will be able to access this website from any device with a web browser. Your design should be robust and flexible to accommodate this variety. *It’s your job as designers to offer a good experience to your user, not their job to bring the right device to your experience.*


## Deliverables

- High fidelity re-design of the website for **two** devices <small>(mobile and desktop/laptop)</small>
- Working prototype of at least one target size <small>(with representative screens of the other)</small>
- Style Tile
- Presentation of iterations and final proposal


## Suggestions

- Break down the **content** of the website
- **Start at low fidelity** and work your way up
- Create a **style tile** early to develop colors and type you can use later to make your hi-fi mockups
- Design **mobile first**
- Create **variations of each screen** to improve your odds of finding a design that works
- **Timebox** your work
- Get feedback early & often
- Iterate
- Perfect is the enemy of good
- Build out your presentation deck as you go
- Work fast; have fun


## Presentation (6 minutes)

Your presentation should answer the following questions:

1. What variations on your design did your group explore?
2. How does your design is improving the existing site being re-designed?
3. What would you do differently next time?


## Bonus

Add some animation to your redesign.
